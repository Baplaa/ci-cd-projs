# CI/CD Projects

This repository serves as a collection of the various Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines I created alongside my former group member [Alexander Nojenko](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexvnojenko/) over the course of my last 14-week semester at BCIT in the CIT program.

## Background

Each directory represents the main branches of the CI/CD pipelines Alex and I created in the "Enterprise System Integration" ACIT 4850 course. The final pipeline featured in this collection—"Tristan CI Functions"—is a solo-developed, supplementary pipeline for [Music Museum](https://github.com/Baplaa/music_museum).
